# FNV BSA Decompressor Patch

This patch allows you to decompress the BSA files when your Fallout New Vegas installation is in Program Files. Normally, the program will prevent you from doing this. I want to do this. Thus the patch.



## How to Patch

1. Download [FNV BSA Decompressor](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65854)
2. Download [Delta Patcher](https://github.com/marco-calautti/DeltaPatcher) (or anything that can apply xdelta patch files)
3. Download [patch.xdelta]()
4. Open Delta Patcher and select FNV BSA Decompressor.exe for the original file and patch.xdelta for the XDelta Patch
5. Click Apply Patch
6. Run FNV BSA Decompressor.exe as admin and click decompress
